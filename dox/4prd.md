# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
AI-Powered PMS Integration Platform

## 1. Product Vision
To deliver a robust, AI-driven platform that enables rapid, secure, and scalable integration of third-party Property Management Systems (PMS) with the RGBridge messaging standard, minimizing manual effort and maximizing extensibility, compliance, and user experience.

## 2. Product Goals
- Automate PMS onboarding and mapping using GenAI.
- Provide a professional, intuitive UI for integration engineers and business users.
- Ensure all integrations are secure, compliant, and versioned.
- Support plug-and-play PMS translators and modular codebase.

## 3. Key Features
### 3.1 PMS API Gateway
- Dynamic endpoint: `/pms/{pmscode}`
- Supports multiple authentication methods (basic, bearer, API key)
- Receives PMS messages in JSON, XML, GraphQL, or SOAP

### 3.2 Message Translation Engine
- Validates incoming PMS messages against provided schema
- Translates PMS messages to RGBridge format using static and AI-assisted mappings
- Handles both separate and combined message types (Availability, Rate, Combined)
- Validates generated RGBridge messages against XSD/schema

### 3.3 Mapping Knowledge Base
- Stores all RGBridge tags/attributes, types, and constraints in YAML/JSON
- Maintains PMS-specific mapping files, versioned and never overwritten
- Supports AI-powered mapping suggestions and manual overrides

### 3.4 Plugin System for Translators
- Class-based, auto-discovery of PMS translators (folder-per-PMS)
- Extensible for new PMS features without affecting existing integrations

### 3.5 UI Wizard for Onboarding
- Step-by-step, horizontal, colorful, professional UI (React + Material UI)
- Steps: Upload PMS spec → Auto-detect mappings (AI) → Manual mapping → Generate/preview files → Test translation → Deploy integration
- Provides clear feedback, error messages, and documentation

### 3.6 Outbound Message Delivery
- Pushes RGBridge messages to internal API via HTTP POST (XML, basic auth)
- Implements retry logic, error handling, and audit trail

### 3.7 Testing & Validation
- Automated and manual test case generation for translators and mappings
- CI/CD integration for automated build, test, and deployment

### 3.8 Security & Compliance
- GDPR/PCI compliance, secure credential storage, encrypted communication
- Logging and audit trail for all integration activities

## 4. User Stories
- As an integration engineer, I want to onboard a new PMS via a UI wizard so that I can quickly generate and test mappings.
- As a product owner, I want all integrations to be versioned and non-destructive so that previous work is never lost.
- As a QA tester, I want automated test cases for each PMS integration so that I can ensure correctness and compliance.
- As a PMS partner, I want my message formats to be supported (JSON/XML/GraphQL/SOAP) so that integration is seamless.
- As a security officer, I want all sensitive data to be encrypted and audit trails maintained so that compliance is ensured.

## 5. UX/UI Requirements
- Professional, colorful, horizontal wizard layout (React + Material UI)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Clear progress indicators and contextual help
- Error messages and AI suggestions for unclear mappings
- Preview and download options for generated mapping/translator files
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Backend: C#/.NET (ASP.NET Core Web API)
- Frontend: React + Material UI
- AI Integration: OpenAI API
- Storage: YAML/JSON for mappings, per PMS
- Testing: xUnit/NUnit for .NET, Jest for frontend
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps
- Cloud deployment: Azure, AWS, or GCP
- Schema validation: XSD for RGBridge, JSON Schema for PMS
- Secure credential management

## 7. Metrics & KPIs
- Time to onboard a new PMS (target: <1 hour with valid specs)
- % of mappings auto-detected by AI (target: >80%)
- Number of successful RGBridge messages delivered
- Number of integration errors or mapping issues
- User satisfaction (integration engineers, PMS partners)
- Compliance audit pass rate

## 8. Release Plan
- **Phase 1:** Project setup, RGBridge schema extraction, initial backend/frontend scaffolding
- **Phase 2:** Core translation engine, mapping knowledge base, plugin system, basic UI wizard
- **Phase 3:** AI integration, advanced mapping, test automation, outbound delivery, error handling
- **Phase 4:** Security, compliance, documentation, and production deployment
- **Phase 5:** Continuous improvement, new PMS features, and user feedback integration

## 9. Open Questions
- What is the preferred cloud provider for production deployment?
- Are there specific PMS partners to prioritize for initial onboarding?
- What is the expected volume of concurrent integrations?
