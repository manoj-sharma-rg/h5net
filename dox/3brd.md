# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Title
AI-Powered PMS Integration Platform

## 1. Executive Summary
The AI-Powered PMS Integration Platform is designed to streamline and automate the integration of third-party Property Management Systems (PMS) with the RGBridge messaging standard. Leveraging GenAI (OpenAI API), the platform will accelerate onboarding, reduce manual mapping, and ensure robust, secure, and scalable integrations for hospitality technology partners.

## 2. Business Objectives
- **Accelerate PMS Onboarding:** Reduce time and effort required to integrate new PMS partners.
- **Minimize Manual Effort:** Automate mapping and code generation using AI, with human-in-the-loop for ambiguous cases.
- **Ensure Data Consistency:** Enforce RGBridge message standards and validation for all integrations.
- **Enhance Extensibility:** Support plug-and-play PMS translators and non-destructive, versioned integrations.
- **Improve User Experience:** Provide a professional, intuitive UI for technical and business users.
- **Maintain Compliance:** Adhere to GDPR, PCI, and industry best practices for data security and privacy.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner:** Responsible for feature prioritization and business alignment.
- **Integration Engineers:** Implement and maintain PMS integrations.
- **QA/Testers:** Validate mapping logic and end-to-end flows.
- **PMS Partners:** External vendors whose systems are being integrated.
- **Compliance & Security Teams:** Ensure regulatory and security requirements are met.
- **End Users:** Hotel operators, channel managers, and support staff.

## 4. Scope
### In Scope
- API Gateway for PMS-specific endpoints (e.g., `/pms/{pmscode}`)
- Authentication (basic, bearer, API key)
- Message translation from PMS format (JSON/XML/GraphQL/SOAP) to RGBridge format
- AI-assisted mapping and code generation
- Static, versioned mapping knowledge base (YAML/JSON)
- Plugin system for PMS translators (auto-discovery, folder-per-PMS)
- UI wizard for onboarding new PMS integrations
- Automated schema validation and error handling
- Outbound message delivery to internal API (HTTP POST, XML)
- Logging, audit trail, and retry logic
- Automated and manual test support
- CI/CD and cloud deployment readiness

### Out of Scope
- Direct PMS vendor management
- Non-RGBridge message formats for outbound delivery
- Legacy system migrations

## 5. Functional Requirements
- The system must allow onboarding of new PMS integrations via a UI wizard.
- Each PMS integration must have a unique API endpoint and folder structure.
- Incoming PMS messages must be validated against their schema.
- The system must translate PMS messages to RGBridge format using static mappings and AI suggestions.
- Unclear mappings must be flagged for user review and confirmation.
- Generated RGBridge messages must be validated against XSD/schema before delivery.
- The system must support multiple authentication methods for API gateways.
- All mapping and translator files must be versioned and never overwritten.
- The system must log all integration activities and errors.
- The platform must be extensible for new PMS features and non-destructive to existing integrations.
- Automated tests must be generated and executed for new integrations.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** GDPR/PCI compliance, secure credential storage, encrypted communication.
- **Performance:** Onboarding a new PMS should take less than 1 hour with valid specs.
- **Reliability:** Retry logic for outbound message delivery; error handling and acknowledgements.
- **Usability:** Professional, colorful, horizontal UI wizard; clear error messages and documentation.
- **Scalability:** Support for concurrent onboarding and operation of multiple PMS integrations.
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase, clear documentation, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

## 7. Success Criteria
- 100% of new PMS integrations completed via the UI wizard with minimal manual intervention.
- All RGBridge messages validated and delivered successfully to internal API.
- No regression or data loss in existing integrations when new PMS is added.
- Compliance with GDPR/PCI and internal security standards.
- Positive feedback from integration engineers and PMS partners.

## 8. Compliance & Regulatory
- All data processing and storage must comply with GDPR and PCI requirements.
- Audit trails must be maintained for all integration activities.
- Sensitive credentials must be securely stored and never exposed in logs or UI.

## 9. Assumptions & Dependencies
- PMS partners will provide complete and accurate message specifications.
- OpenAI API and cloud infrastructure are available and reliable.
- Internal API for RGBridge message delivery is stable and documented.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Ambiguous PMS specs:** Mitigated by AI suggestions and human review.
- **API downtime:** Retry logic and alerting.
- **Security breaches:** Regular audits, encrypted storage, and strict access controls.

## 11. Glossary
- **PMS:** Property Management System
- **RGBridge:** Internal message format standard
- **GenAI:** Generative AI (e.g., OpenAI API)
- **Mapping:** Field-to-field transformation between PMS and RGBridge formats
