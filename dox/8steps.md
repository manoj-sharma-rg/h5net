Setting up the CI/CD pipeline
- Created GitHub Actions workflows:
  - ci-cd.yml (main pipeline with testing, building, deployment)
  - pr-check.yml (pull request validation)
  - dependency-check.yml (weekly dependency updates)
- Added comprehensive CI/CD documentation
- Created environment setup scripts for GitHub CLI

AI Integration (OpenAI/GenAI)
Goal: Automate mapping suggestions, code generation, and test case creation using OpenAI.
Steps:
Backend Service for OpenAI
Create a service in your .NET API (e.g., Services/AiIntegrationService.cs) to interact with OpenAI.
Add configuration for OpenAI API key (use environment variables/secrets).
Implement methods for:
Field mapping suggestions (input: PMS spec + field names, output: suggested RGBridge fields).
Code generation for translators (input: PMS spec, output: C# code).
Test case generation (input: mapping, output: sample test data).
Expose AI Endpoints
Add API endpoints (e.g., /api/ai/suggest-mapping, /api/ai/generate-code) that the UI can call.
UI Integration
Update the onboarding wizard to call these endpoints for mapping suggestions and code previews.
Display AI suggestions and allow user approval/override.
Security
Store OpenAI API key securely (never in code or logs).
Rate-limit and log AI calls for audit/compliance.
2. Schema Validation
Goal: Ensure all incoming PMS messages and outgoing RGBridge messages are valid.
Steps:
PMS Message Validation
For JSON: Use a .NET JSON Schema validator (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json.Schema).
For XML: Use .NET’s built-in XSD validation.
Store/upload schemas per PMS in their folder.
RGBridge Message Validation
Extract/create XSD for RGBridge format (from your XML samples).
Validate generated RGBridge XML before sending.
Error Handling
Return clear validation errors to the UI and logs.
Add tests for invalid/edge-case messages.
3. Outbound RGBridge Message Delivery
Goal: Push translated messages to your internal API with reliability and security.
Steps:
Implement Outbound Sender
Create a service (e.g., RgbridgeSenderService) to POST XML to the internal API.
Use basic authentication (credentials from config/secrets).
Implement retry logic (e.g., Polly library for .NET).
Logging & Acknowledgement
Log all outbound attempts, responses, and errors.
Handle and surface delivery failures to the UI.
Configuration
Store internal API endpoint and credentials securely.
4. Plugin System Auto-Discovery
Goal: Make PMS translators plug-and-play, with no manual registration.
Steps:
Dynamic Loading
Use reflection to scan the pms/ directory for new translator classes implementing IPmsTranslator.
Register discovered translators at startup.
Hot Reload (Optional)
For advanced use, implement file watchers to auto-load new translators without restart.
Documentation
Document how to add a new PMS translator for developers.
5. Automated Testing
Goal: Ensure every integration is robust and correct.
Steps:
AI-Generated Test Cases
Use OpenAI to generate sample PMS payloads and expected RGBridge outputs.
Store these as test cases in the PMS folder.
Unit/Integration Tests
Expand xUnit/NUnit tests for translators and mapping logic.
Add tests for schema validation and outbound delivery.
CI/CD Integration
Ensure all tests run in your GitHub Actions workflows.
6. RGBridge Knowledge Base
Goal: Maintain a static, versioned list of all RGBridge fields/tags/types.
Steps:
Extract Schema
Parse your RGBridge XML samples and create a YAML/JSON file listing all fields, types, and constraints.
Use in Mapping
Reference this knowledge base in AI mapping and validation logic.
Versioning
Update the knowledge base as RGBridge evolves, with clear version history.
7. Security & Compliance
Goal: Ensure GDPR/PCI compliance and production security.
Steps:
Enforce HTTPS
Require HTTPS in production (update API and Docker config).
Data Protection
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Review logs for sensitive data exposure.
Audit & Access Controls
Log all access to sensitive endpoints and data.
Restrict access to admin/config endpoints.
Compliance Review
Review against GDPR/PCI checklists (data retention, user rights, etc.).
8. UI/UX Polish
Goal: Deliver a professional, accessible, and user-friendly experience.
Steps:
Accessibility
Audit UI for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (labels, contrast, keyboard navigation).
Branding & Theming
Apply your company’s branding and color palette.
Add contextual help/tooltips and error/success feedback.
Documentation
Add onboarding guides and tooltips in the wizard.
9. Extensibility & Versioning
Goal: Ensure integrations are non-destructive and versioned.
Steps:
File Versioning
Add version fields to mapping/manifest files.
Never overwrite existing files—create new versions or append.
Change Management
Track changes to mappings/translators per PMS.
10. Monitoring & Observability
Goal: Enable real-time monitoring and alerting.
Steps:
Prometheus/Grafana
Ensure metrics endpoints are scraped by Prometheus.
Provide default Grafana dashboards.
Alerting
Set up alerts for failures, high error rates, and performance issues.
11. Documentation & Developer Experience
Goal: Make it easy for others to use, extend, and maintain the platform.
Steps:
API Reference
Ensure Swagger/OpenAPI docs are complete and up-to-date.
How-To Guides
Write guides for onboarding new PMS, troubleshooting, and extending the platform.
Contribution Guidelines
Add a CONTRIBUTING.md for developers.
